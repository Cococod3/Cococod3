Apart from my artistic career, I also persue a life as a surf instructor and hotelier. I have managed and opened 3 boutique hotels in Madrid, managing teams from 10 to 30 employees.


###### Some fun facts about me: :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: 
I was born in Finland but have been raised in MÃ¡laga. My family on my father's side is English and mother's Finnish. I speak the three languages.
*My five year plan would be: me, able to work in web development, manage my own team and at the same time, spend the rest of my days in the water with my board* :ocean:
